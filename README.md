Python Web Scraping From Indeed Job Postings


For this project, I used the Beautiful Soup library along with urllib and regex to scrape Data Analyst job listings from Indeed.com. While the main objective of this project was to build a functional web scraper, after collecting the data from Indeed, I built two predictive models, a logistic regression, and a random forest classifier.


· Built  a web scraper to extract 794 data analyst job postings from Indeed.com and parse through job descriptions and titles 
· Rank them according to the presence of certain keywords, and produce a condensed spreadsheet with any relevant information
· Analyzed different jobs posts to understand the job market demand, in terms of job titles, skills, industries and locations
