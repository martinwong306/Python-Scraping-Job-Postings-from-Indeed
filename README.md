Python Web Scraping From Indeed Job Postings


For this project, I used the Beautiful Soup library along with urllib and regex to scrape Data Analyst job listings from Indeed.com. While the main objective of this project was to build a functional web scraper, after collecting the data from Indeed, I built two predictive models, a logistic regression, and a random forest classifier.
